 All values are hexidecimal, separated by whitespace.
 Lines starting with a non-hex digit are ignored (comment lines.)
 First six (6) values are TIA registers, next nine (9) values are POKEY registers, final value is number of frames to repeat.
 Unspecified values are interpreted as zeros.
 The following are the specific register orderings:
