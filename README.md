> Mike Murphy (mike@emu7800.net) - 12/1/2022

EMU7800 was originally completed in 2003 as a .NET programming exercise.
It continues to be maintained to the present day as a non-commercial endeavor.
Feel free to email feedback.
Enjoy!

## Building from Source

To build, the following tools are needed:

- [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

- [Inno Setup Compiler 6.2.1](https://www.innosetup.com/)

To execute the build, run ```dotnet msbuild``` from a command-prompt at the root of the source directory (where this README is found.)
This will build and drop everything under a newly created sub-directory ```artifacts\```.
