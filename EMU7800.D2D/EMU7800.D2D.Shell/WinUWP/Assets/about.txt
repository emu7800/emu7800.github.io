EMU7800 offers classic video game nostalgia on demand! It is a portrayal of the Atari 7800 ProSystem video game console experience (c. 1987) that included compatibility with the older and more popular Atari 2600 Video Computer System.

PERFORMANCE—EMU7800 will be able to run full speed on systems with the equivalent of a single 1.7 GHz CPU core. The frame rate will adjust downward automatically if necessary.

GAME CONTROLLERS—Up to four (4) Xbox 360 controllers are supported and should generally work as expected. USB adapters that facilitate use of the original Atari controllers are also supported (2600-daptor, 2600-daptor II, and Stelladaptor.) The keyboard and mouse are also usable for game control. Some specific tips:

- Use keys F1-F4 to direct the input to the respective player number
- Use the W key to swap input jacks, the Q key to swap P1/P2 paddles, the E key to swap P3/P4 paddles
- The right thumbstick on the first Xbox controller operates the Player Two joystick as there are a few single-player titles that leverage both joysticks together
- The X and Y buttons on Xbox 360 controllers will swap input jacks (same as W key)
- The left and right triggers operate the Game Select and Game Reset console switches respectively (also mapped to the S and R keys)
- Only mouse input is mapped to the Lightgun controller
- Number pad keys are mapped to the Atari Keypad controller
- The H key toggles the Heads Up Display (HUD) during gameplay where recognized controllers are shown
- Left and right fire buttons are mapped to the Z/X keys respectively
- The PageDown/PageUp keys toggle power

HUD—During gameplay, the settings icon at the upper left will activate the Heads Up Display (HUD). The top row of buttons emulates the hardware switches of the Atari console. Cycling the Power button will clear game state and settings for the current title. Touch screen game controls can be activated here; tap or click middle of the screen to adjust separation.
