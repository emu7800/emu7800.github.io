EMU7800 offers classic video game nostalgia on the go! It emulates the Atari 7800 ProSystem video game console (c. 1987) that was also backward-compatible with the older and more popular Atari 2600 Video Computer System.

WHATS NEW—EMU7800 is now available on Android devices!

BASIC OPERATION—Several classic games are included to jump start your experience. Many additional ROM files are recognizable by EMU7800; use the search icon on the title screen to import them. Game states and settings are always preserved by default. The selection screen will display a Paused icon when there is pre-existing game state for a particular title.

PERFORMANCE—EMU7800 is CPU intensive. Early handsets did not have enough CPU capacity to run games full speed, though newer generation hardware is closing this gap. For example, recent testing on an HTC Windows Phone 8X had no problems running at full speed. EMU7800 will automatically calibrate-down to accommodate resource-constrained devices.

HUD—During gameplay, the settings icon at the upper left will activate the Heads Up Display (HUD). The top row of buttons emulates the hardware switches of the Atari console. Cycling the Power button will clear game state and settings for the current title. Touch screen game controls can be activated here.

KEYBOARD INPUT—Available keys: Left/Right Fire (Z/X), Directional (DPad/Arrows), Game Select (S), Game Reset (R), Game Pause (P), Toggle HUD (H), Player # Switch (F1-F4).

ABOUT—EMU7800 was fundamentally a Windows platform porting experiment, using an Atari emulator code base from a previous project. It is primarily authored in C#. Current platforms are Win32, Win8-8.1 RT, Windows Phone 8.1, and Android. Xbox One will become a new target should the requisite SDK become available in the future.
