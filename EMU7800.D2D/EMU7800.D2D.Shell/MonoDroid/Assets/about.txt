EMU7800 offers classic video game nostalgia on the go! It emulates the Atari 7800 ProSystem video game console (c. 1987) that was also backward-compatible with the older and more popular Atari 2600 Video Computer System.

WHATS NEW—EMU7800 is now available on Android devices!

BASIC OPERATION—Several classic games are included to jump start your experience. Many additional ROM files are recognizable by EMU7800; use the search icon on the title screen to import them. Game states and settings are always preserved by default. The selection screen will display a Paused icon when there is pre-existing game state for a particular title. Visit www.atariage.com for manuals, box art, and game tips.

PERFORMANCE—EMU7800 will be able to run full speed on systems with the equivalent of a single 1.7 GHz CPU core. The frame rate will automatically adjust downward to maintain smoothness if necessary.

HUD—During gameplay, the settings icon at the upper left will activate the Heads Up Display (HUD). The top row of buttons emulates the hardware switches of the Atari console. Cycling the Power button will clear game state and settings for the current title. Touch screen game controls can be activated here; tap or click middle of the screen to adjust separation.

KEYBOARD INPUT—Available keys: Left/Right Fire (Z/X), Directional (DPad/Arrows), Game Select (S), Game Reset (R), Game Pause (P), Toggle HUD (H), Player # Switch (F1-F4).
