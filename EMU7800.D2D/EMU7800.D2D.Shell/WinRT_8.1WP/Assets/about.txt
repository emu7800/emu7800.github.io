EMU7800 offers classic video game nostalgia on the go! It emulates the Atari 7800 ProSystem video game console (c. 1987) that was also backward-compatible with the older and more popular Atari 2600 Video Computer System.

WHATS NEW—Replaced legacy WP7 code base with the current Windows RT code base currently running on Windows Store. Consequently, ROM imports are now supported. Added ability to swap input jacks via the W key. Back and Settings buttons on game screen now reappear when the keyboard or screen are touched. .NET Native builds are coming soon, which will improve performance on lower-end hardware.

BASIC OPERATION—Several classic games are included to jump start your experience. Many additional ROM files are recognizable by EMU7800; use the search icon on the title screen to import them. Game states and settings are always preserved by default. The selection screen will display a Paused icon when there is pre-existing game state for a particular title.

PERFORMANCE—EMU7800 is CPU intensive. Early handsets did not have enough CPU capacity to run games full speed, though newer generation hardware is closing this gap. For example, recent testing on an HTC Windows Phone 8X had no problems running at full speed. EMU7800 will automatically calibrate-down to accommodate resource-constrained scenarios.

GAME CONTROLLERS—MOGA mobile gaming controllers offer the best gameplay experience. If you are serious about your gaming nostalgia, consider obtaining one of these devices. Make sure your controller is turned on and connected with your phone prior to launching. (Look for BD&A in the Bluetooth settings.) Controller should activate at the title screen. Some specific tips:

- The right thumbstick operates the Player Two joystick as there are a few single-player titles that leverage both joysticks together
- The X and Y buttons will swap input jacks
- The controller can be used to navigate the selection screen
- Lightgun and Paddle games do not use the MOGA controller

HUD—During gameplay, the settings icon at the upper left will activate the Heads Up Display (HUD). The top row of buttons emulates the hardware switches of the Atari console. Cycling the Power button will clear game state and settings for the current title. Touch screen game controls can be activated here.

ABOUT—EMU7800 is fundamentally a Windows platform porting experiment, using an Atari emulator code base from a previous project. It is primarily authored in C# with some C++ to interoperate with Direct2D. Current platforms are Win32, Win8-8.1 PC, Win8-8.1 RT, and Windows Phone 8.1. Xbox One will become a new target should the requisite SDK become available in the future.
